# Java-Recursive-Series-Calculator
This program provides a console-based interface to calculate the sum of two distinct mathematical series

1. A division-based series defined as ∑ (1 / (i + (i - 1))) from i=2 to n.
2. A multiplication-based series defined as ∑ (i²) from i=1 to n.

## **Features**
- Enumerated menu options for better code clarity and error handling.
- Recursive methods for both series calculations.
- Error handling for invalid and non-numeric inputs.
- Aesthetically pleasing console output with centered titles.
